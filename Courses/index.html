                    languages including those that are compiled and interpreted.
                    The course shows how to implement algorithms and data
                    structures to solve problems while utilizing paradigms
                    offered by the programming languages such as procedural,
                    object-oriented, protocol-oriented, functional, and
                    declarative. Language support for strong and weak typing and
                    type safety are covered along with support for optional
                    values. Provides experience in developing algorithms and
                    determining their efficiency, designing application
                    architecture, and developing applications. Building and
                    using libraries/application programming interfaces is
                    covered. Git and GitHub are used for code versioning and
                    collaboration. Integrated development environments (IDEs)
                    are used for managing, building, debugging, and testing
                    applications.

                    assesses student teams and their ability to produce a 
                    portfolio of work demonstrating their level of knowledge 
                    of related fields, ability to work collaboratively, to

                    represented by the creation of a final project evaluated

                    conceptualization, design and discovery, and implementation. 
                    Students choose or are otherwise assigned to student teams 
                    and will work with those individuals throughout the semester 
                    to complete the work.
